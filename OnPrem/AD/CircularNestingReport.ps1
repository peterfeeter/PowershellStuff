Function Get-ADCircularGroups {
    <# 
    .SYNOPSIS
        Find instances of circular nested groups.
    
    .DESCRIPTION
        A PowerShell script to find any instances of circular nested groups in the domain. 
        The program finds and reports on all groups involved in circular nesting.
        A useful feature of Active Directory is that groups can be nested. However, it is 
        possible for the group nesting to be circular. For example, if group "Grade 1" is a 
        member of group "Students", and group "Students" is a member of "School", and group 
        "School" is a member of "Grade 1", the group nesting is circular.
        This program efficiently finds all circular nested groups. It uses the 
        System.DirectoryServices.DirectorySearcher class to retrieve all group names and their 
        direct memberships. The member attribute of the groups is a collection of the 
        Distinguished Names of all direct members, but does not reveal "primary" group membership. 
        The program evaluates each group to track down members that are groups. As soon as a 
        nested member is found that is identical to any parent group, the program has found an 
        instance of circular nesting.
        The program does not report on how the groups are nested. For example, if the program 
        lists 5 groups, there are several ways the groups could be nested. There could be one 
        instance involving the 5 groups, or one instance involving 2 groups and another involving 
        3 groups. Given the group names you will need to track down how they are nested.
    .PARAMETER OU
        Name of the organizational unit where the script will look for nested groups. The OU
        will be searched recursively. When the OU parameter is omitted, the entire domain will 
        be searched.
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Find all circular groups in two different organizational units and show verbose messages.
        Get-ADCircularGroups -OU 'OU=BEL,OU=EU,DC=contoso,DC=com', 'OU=DEU,OU=EU,DC=contoso,DC=com' -Verbose
    
    .EXAMPLE
        Find all circular groups in the domain.
